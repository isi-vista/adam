        partial isomorphism mapping.   The logic should focus on semantic
        information contained in the edge data or a formalized node class.

        By acceptable, we mean that the subsequent mapping can still become a
        complete isomorphism mapping.  Thus, if adding the candidate pair

        complete isomorphism mapping, then this function must return False.

            Indicates that the graph matcher is looking for a subgraph-graph
            monomorphism such that a subgraph of G1 is monomorphic to G2.

        Any subclass which redefines semantic_feasibility() must maintain
