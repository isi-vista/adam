"""
The `Ontology` for use in ISI's GAILA Phase 1 effort.

Note that this `Ontology` is only used for training and testing example generation; the learner
has no access to it.

The following will eventually end up here:

- Objects: mommy, daddy, baby, book, house, car, water, ball, juice, cup, box, chair, head,
  milk, hand, dog, truck, door, hat, table, cookie, bird
- Actions/Verbs: go, put, come, take, eat, give, turn, sit, drink, push, fall, throw, move, jump,
  has (possessive), give, roll, fly
- Relations, Modifiers, Function Words: basic color terms (red, blue, green, white, blackâ€¦), one,
  two, I, me, my, you, your, to, in, on, [beside, behind, in front of, over, under], up, down
