Visual Representation based on

David Marr, Vision, Chapter 5 "Presenting Shapes for Recognition".

This code and its comments presumes familiarity with that chapter; the book should be available
from any university library (usually digitally).

Marr's represent objects in terms of hierarchical structures with object-centered coordinate
systems, which he calls "models".  Marr's exposition does not sharply distinguish a
model-as-a-representation-of-a-particular-object-instance from
model-as-a-representation-of-an-object-class.  In code we need to be a little more explicit, so
we call the former a `Marr3dObject` and the latter a `Marr3dModel`.

Unfortunately, Python's lack of forward declarations means the classes in this module are not
declared in the best order for reading.  I suggest reading them in the following order:

These describe the model-as-representation-of-a-particular-object-instance (e.g. the particular
truck I see right now):
- `Marr3dObject`
- `Cylinder`
- `AdjunctRelation`

These describe model-as-a-representation-of-an-object-class (e.g. trucks in general):
- `Marr3dModel`
- `CylinderRange`
- `AdjunctRelationRange`

These describe the structures which can be used to match instances to class (that is, to identify
what it is you are looking at):
- MarrModelIndex
- SpecificityIndex
- SpecificityIndexNode
