    A particular experimental configuration.

    An experiment specifies what data is fed to the `LanguageLearner`, what `LanguageLearner` is
    used and how it is configured, how the trained `LanguageLearner` is tested, and what
    analysis is done on the results.

    At various stages in the experiment,
    `DescriptionObserver`\ s will be able to examine
    the descriptions of situations produced by the `LanguageLearner`.
    Based on their observations, they can provide reports at the end of the experiment.
