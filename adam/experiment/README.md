# Experimentation Setup
Our experiments can be influenced by a number of parameters. This guide is intended to list all potential parameters, their impacts on the relevant portion of the curriculum, and any conflicting settings. Parameters are written using the following line format:
`- param_name: type (Optional: Default) - Description`

## State Restoration
As described below, our experiments have a parameter `resume_from_latest_logged_state` which, if true, does attempt to restart an experiment from the latest logged state. However, currently the experiment may restore the observers and the learners to different states IF the 'latest state' doesn't match between these logged folders.

### Curriculum Pre-Generation
- curriculum_repository_path: Path (Optional) - A directory where pre-generated curriculum have been stored, used to save on recreating the curriculum each time an experiment runs.
    - Note that to use this parameter, the curriculum in use must be pre-generated using the script `adam.experiment.generate_curriculum`. All curriculum-related parameters must be the same when pre-generating the curriculum.

## Generic Parameter Control
These parameters are independent of any specific experiment.

### Optional: Pegasus Workflow Params
This section of parameters is specific to using the Pegasus workflow management tool in combination with the ISI Saga cluster.

## Learner Parameters
### How To Define an Integrated Learner
The integrated learner can be initialized many different ways in an experiment. The best way is to use `learner_type: "integrated-learner-params"` because this functionality extends an ability to fine tune all parameters and learner types. To use this learner type the namespaces `object_learner`, `attribute_learner`, `plural_learner`, `relation_learner`, and `action_learner` all follow the same layout below:
- learner_type: str (Optional: "subset") - Indicates which learner model will be loaded. Normally the valid options are: "subset", "pursuit", and "none"
- ontology: str (Optional: "phase2") - Indicates which ontology should be loaded with the learner
- suppress_error: bool (Optional: True) - Indicates if runtime errors during the learning process should be suppressed to avoid program termination. Suppressed errors are instances which the learner does not learn from

Any additional parameters for a learner type as described below should also be placed directly in the namespace. This configuration allows for detailed configuration of individual components.

Finally we have two types of of learners which are special implementations which don't directly follow the subset or pursuit models. These are functional objects learner and a generics model. To add these learners into the integrated model configure the following parameters:
- include_functional_learner: Boolean (Optional: True) - Include the functional learner model
- include_generics_learner: Boolean (Optional: True) - Include the functional learner model

As an example here's how one would specify the Propose-But-Verify Object Learner with random seed 42.
```
object_learner:
    learner_type: pbv
    random_seed: 42
```

### Subset
*Valid For: Object, Attribute, Plural, Relation, Action*
None

### Propose But Verify
*Valid For: Object*
- graph_match_confirmation_threshold: Float (Optional: 0.8) - A value between 0 and 1 which indicates how much a new hypothesis must match a previous pattern to count as a successful match.
- random_seed: Integer (Optional: 0) - A seed for the RandomChooser which will make the random decisions between possible meanings

### Cross-Situational
*Valid For: Object*
- graph_match_confirmation_threshold: Float (Optional: 0.8) - A value between 0 and 1 which indicates how much a new hypothesis must match a previous pattern to count as a successful match.
- lexicon_entry_threshold: Float - A float between 0 and 1 controlling when the learner will consider a word's meaning "known" and enter that word into its lexicon
- smoothing_parameter: Float - A small positive number added to each hypothesis score when updating hypotheses. This should be at most 0.1 and possibly much less.
- expected_number_of_meanings: Float - A positive number giving an upper bound for the number of possible abstract meanings (cat, dog, etc. rather than a cat in a scene). For the phase 1 ontology this should be set to at least 67.

### Pursuit
*Valid For: Object, Attribute, Relation*
- learning_factor: Float - The learning factor rate
- graph_match_confirmation_threshold: Float - A value between 0 and 1 which indicates how much a new hypothesis must match a previous pattern to count as a successful match.
- lexicon_entry_threshold: Float - A value between 0 and 1 which indicates what probability a concept should be allowed into the 'known' lexicon
- smoothing_parameter: Float - A value between 0 and 1 which is generally small which smooths the probabilities over time.
- random_seed: Integer (Optional: 0) - A seed for the RandomChooser which is used in this learner
- rank_gaze_higher: Boolean (Optional: False) - Enable the modifications to prioritize pursuit to objects which are `gazed-at` in the perception rather than a random sample of the entire scene

### Object Recognizer
*Valid For: Object*
While not strictly a 'learner', this option builds in the knowledge of objects to the integrated learner removing any doubt around the learner's ability to recognize objects.
