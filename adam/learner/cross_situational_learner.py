    An Abstract Implementation of the Cross Situation Learning Model

    This learner aims to learn via storing all possible meanings and narrowing down to one meaning
    by calculating association scores and probability based off those association scores for each
    utterance situation pair. It does so be associating all words to certain meanings. For new words
    meanings that are not associated strongly to another word already are associated evenly. For
    words encountered before, words are associated more strongly to meanings encountered with that
    word before and less strongly to newer meanings. Lastly, very familiar word meaning pairs are
    associated together only, these would be words generally considered lexicalized. Once
    associations are made a probability for each word meaning pair being correct is calculated.
    Finally if the probability is high enough the word is lexicalized. More information can be
    found here: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01104.x
