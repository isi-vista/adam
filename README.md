# Introduction

ADAM is ISI's effort under DARPA's Grounded Artificial Intelligence Language Acquisition (GAILA) program.
Background for the GAILA program is given in [DARPA's call for proposals](https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=b084633eb2501d60932bb77bf5ffb192)
and [here is a video](https://youtu.be/xGsIKHKqKdw) of a talk giving an overview of our plans for ADAM
(aimed at an audience familiar with the GAILA program).

Documentation can be found [here](https://adam-language-learner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
The documentation includes tutorials on how to use ADAM (though it may not appear on Read the Docs).

You can check out our papers to read more about the system and to cite our work:

1. [ADAM: A Sandbox for Implementing Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02263)
2. [A Grounded Approach to Modeling Generic Knowledge Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03207)

# Project Setup

1. Create a Python 3.7 Anaconda environment (or your favorite other means of creating a virtual environment): `conda create --name adam python=3.7` followed by `conda activate adam`.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Make a file under `parameters` called `root.params` which contains:

   ```
   adam_root: PATH_TO_WORKING_COPY_OF_THIS_REPO
   # if you want to view experiment results in the UI, you must point adam_experiment_root to
   # %adam_root%/data, otherwise any directory is fine:
   adam_experiment_root: %adam_root%/data

   conda_environment: adam
   conda_base_path: PATH_TO_ANACONDA_DIRECTORY
   ```

## Using PyPy

1. Complete the project setup as above.
2. Install PyPy 3.7: `conda install -c conda-forge pypy3.7`.
3. To run tests using PyPy3.7: `make test`.

# Documentation

To generate Sphinx documentation:

```
cd docs
make html
```

The docs will be under `docs/_build/html`

# To generate an HTML dump of the curriculum

Run `adam.curriculum_to_html /full/path/to/parameters/html/curriculum_to_html.phase1.params`

# To Run the Learner over an Entire Curriculum

Run `adam.experiment.run_m9 /full/path/to/parameters/experiment/m9/m9.params`

# To Run the angular viewer application

First, make sure the Flask backend is running. To start the backend:

```bash
cd adam/flask_backend
bash start_flask.sh &
```

The angular application is located under `/angular-viewer/adam-angular-demo`
Navigate to the directory above and serve the application locally on port 4200:

```
ng serve --open
```

# To install npm on your machine

```
npm install -g npm
```

# To install font dependencies on your machine

```
cd {adam_root}
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/install_fonts.py
```

For more detailed information including how to check npm versions on your machine, please refer: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

# Languages

Currently, our curriculum dump and learner run in English by default, but they are also runnable in Chinese.
Our Chinese implementation uses Yale romanization to maintain UTF-8 encoding, but this can easily be [converted to the more common
Pinyin romanization](https://ctext.org/pinyin.pl?if=en&text=&from=yale&to=pinyin).

To generate a curriculum dump or run the learner in Chinese, add the following line to your `parameters/root.params` file:

```
language_mode : CHINESE
```

and then run the commands given above.
