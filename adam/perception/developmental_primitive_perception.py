    A static snapshot of a `Situation` based on developmentally-motivated perceptual primitives.

    This represents a situation as

    - a set of `ObjectPerception`\ s, with one corresponding to each
      object in the scene (e.g. a ball, Mom, Dad, etc.)
    - a set of `PropertyPerception`\ s which associate a `ObjectPerception` with perceived
      properties
      of various sort (e.g. color, sentience, etc.)
    - a set of `Relation`\ s which describe the learner's perception of how two
      `ObjectPerception`\ s are related.

    This is the default perceptual representation for at least the first phase of the ADAM project.
